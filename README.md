# OpenVI - Open toolkit for Computer Vision

This project aims to create a toolkit for computer vision, with image processing and computer vision training with no code. The main features are:

- Image processing graph: Everyone can create image processing graphs with OpenCV. Try the result in real time.
- Training machine learning models for object detection, image classification, and other computer vision tasks.
- Deploy machine learning models to devices.
